Snort rule example

  Look for anonymous ftp traffic:
        alert tcp any any -> any 21 (msg:"Anonymous FTP Login"; content: "anonymous"; sid:2121; )
     
  This will cause the pattern matcher to start looking at byte 6 in the payload)
        alert tcp any any -> any 21 (msg:"Anonymous FTP Login"; content: "anonymous"; offset:5; sid:2121; )
