Based on the OSI model 
  covering layer 1 & 2 today
data refrences the application layer
transport = segment/datagram
packets refrences network
data link = frame
bits refrences the physical

******reliable sources******
IETF
  makes RFC   
    basically whitepages or manuals for protocols
IANA
  passes out ip ranges
  manages root domains ie; .com , .net
IEEE
  hardware standards for the internet
*********************************
      chat gpt copy pastes for pattern rec not nesecarrily the truth


************LAYER 1******************8
Binary
  base 2 
  zeroes and ones
    32 bits = word
    4 bits is a nibble
Decimal
  base 10 
  school math
Hexadecimal
  0-F
  format; 0x42, 0xE3, etc...
  0  = 0
  15 = F
one hex character is a nibble
2 hex is a byte

Base64
  (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, +, /)
  (=) designates null values
    used for padding
Topologies
  Bus
    not commonly used similiar to in series electronics
  Star
    several hosts connected indiviually to a switch 
  Ring
    several hosts connected to eachother in a ring pattern
      data is sent one way in a loop
  Mesh
    everyone connected to everybody
      1 hop max
    partial mesh 
      1 or 2 hops away
  Wireless
    WAP 
      sphere of hosts that hosts can move between
  Hierarchial 
    Enterprise level network
    split into 
      Access layer
      Distribution layer
      Core layer
      Internet
Devices
  Hub
    copy all info to every port
    shitty switch but fast
  Repeaters
    amplifies and push info allong a connection while removing noise  
  switches
    same network
    seperates collsion domains via mac addresses
    move information around inside a network
  Routers
    operate at IP level 
    designed to move information across networks
    usually the default gateway in a network

*************LAYER 2*********************************************
Ethernet 802.3(x) 
Wireless 802.11(x)
Token Ring 802.5

Data link sublayers
  MAC (Medium Acces Control)
  LLC (logical link control)

Message Formating (FRAMES)
  Header
  Data
  Footer/trailer
Encapsulation
  like russian nesting dolls
  used to take the data basically give it an address and the method of movement to the target and maybe encryption

Switches
  build MAC adrress table (cam table)
    builds out table through incoming packets
  Fowards Frames
    pushes traffic based on destination MAC

  Switching Modes
    Cut-Through
      fastes method used for end user
    Fragment-Free
      makes sure whole frame is there before pushing
    Store-And-Forward
      slowest but no mistakes

    CAM Table Overflowo Attack
      frames with bogus MAC Address 
      fills CAM table with garbage     
      switch will not be able to learn new MAC or overwrites old ones
      DOS

  MAC Addressing
    Format
      Windows: 01-23-45.....
      Linux/UNIX: 01:23:45.....
      CISCO: 1234.5612......
    Parts  
      first 24 bits = OUI
      LAST 24 = vendor assigned
    MAC spoofing
      the act of changing a mac address through software, typically to hide tracks
  VLAN
    Virtual local area network
    splits a network so that hosts are seperated usually by trust level or access level
    Trunk Link
      physical cable that allows multiple vlans to cross multiple switches

    VLAN TYPES
      Default - VLAN 1
      Data - User Traffic
      Voice- VOIP Traffic
      Management- Switch and router management
        default built but often not visible
        often outband with access to everyone and noone access to them 
      Native - untagged switch and router traffic

    VLAN Hopping attack
      can push into a vlan with lesser credentials by using another VLAN as cover
      also known as double Tagging 

Protocols 
  ARP
    ARP TYPES
      ARP (op 1 and 2)
      RARP (op 3 and 4)
      Proxy ARP (op 2)
        third party response to a request often used for man in the middle
      Gratuitous ARP (op 2)
        unsolicted ARP response
        often seen with Table poisoning
     ARP Cache
      where your mac to IP resolution is stored
      usually internetwork
      bare minimum has Default gateway
      easily duplicated
